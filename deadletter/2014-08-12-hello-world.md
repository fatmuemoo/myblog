I have had a domain name for many years. Never really did anything with it.
Over the years, I've tried several CMS/Blogging platforms such as WordPress, Joomla and Drupal. I could never really find one that worked well for me, and I never stuck with a blog for then a few weeks. I decided a few weeks ago that I wanted
to try to start bloging again. My requirements are:

 - Something lightweight
 - I don't need a fancy control panel; I'm the only user
 - I want to write in markdown
 - But markdown isn't enough: I need markdown + template engine (In other words, use variables inside markdown)
 - I also only want to use plain text files to write posts
 - I want code highlighting out of the box

I started searching for something that could satisfy these needs. I remembered hearing about [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) from [@beausimensen](https://twitter.com/beausimensen) when I met him at PHP[tek]. I think this might just work for my needs.
