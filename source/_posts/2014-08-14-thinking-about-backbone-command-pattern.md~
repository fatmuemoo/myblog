Lately I have been working with a commanding pattern and CQRS in the back end code. In the context of a rest api, IMO a commanding pattern fits quite nicely. Lets take the example of marking a product as active.

Traditional CRUD Rest API:
PUT /products/123 {active: true}

Commanding Rest API:
POST /products/123/activate

But this isn't the full story. Usually, when use the PUT verb, you have to send the entire entity. When you send the POST verb to send the activate command, it is much more concise and expressive to what you are actually doing. But the POST verb is intended to create entities you say? Well, aren't we just CREATING a command?

This paradigm of using the POST verb to create commands is really quite slick. It creates expressive and meaningful endpoints. For me, there was only one problem: My project is heavily invested in  backbone. Backbone is designed to communicate with a rest api to Create, Update, and Delete entities. I've been thinking about a way to bridge this gap between client side and server side code.

There are some examples of commanding pattern in backbone. These examples, in my opinion, are a little heavy handed. I'm not looking to create a command bus in java script. When i'm working with backbone objects, I usually already have a collection or model in which I am trying to manipulate. I’m thinking about extending Backbone to allow for commands to be sent. Here is some pseudo code for what I’m thinking:

    var Commanding = {
        execute: function (command, context) {
            var self = this;
            this.trigger('command before:' + command, [self, command, context]);
            return $.ajax({
                url: _.result(this, ‘url’),
                method: ‘POST’,
                data: context,
                always: function (data, status, xhr) {
                    var events = ‘command: ‘ + status + ‘ ‘ + status + ‘:’ + command;
                    self.trigger(events, [self, command, context, xhr, data, status]);
                }
            });
        }
    }

    _.extend(Backbone.Model.prototype, Commanding);
    _.extend(Backbone.Collection.prototype, Commanding);

    exmpleModel.execute('activate');
    anotherExampleModel('rename', {'name': 'Foo'});
