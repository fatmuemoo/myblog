Brandon Mueller currently serves as the Lead Software Engineer for K12 Services, Inc. of Rockville, MD. His interest for web development presented itself early in life as he began dabbling in Perl and HTML at the impressionable age of 15. Since he began developing with PHP professionally in 2003, his passion for web development has grown as he has seen the many ways that technology can be applied to solve real-world business problems.
